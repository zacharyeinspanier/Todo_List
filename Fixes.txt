1: Changing type:
    a: can only change when another object is currently selected
    b: data disapears when type is changed



UseEffect runs code on every render, can be run with dependencys


Investigate file:

App WORKING: 
    Use reducer
    New Item
    New Content
    Functions for managing list
    Returns List manager and Display list

List Manager: WORKING
    Allows user to create new List, working
Display List: 
    Displays: List, Note, Note+List
    Going to guess that this is the root of the issue, the note, list, and note+list are all simple
    It could be how I am storing the data
    Could it be that it is just taking what 

Need to be fixed:
List:
Note: 
Could it be that it is just taking what what ever the user inputs and setting it
EX: user enters noting, oting is set
Note+List:
